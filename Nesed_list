#Given the names and grades for each student in a class of  students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.
Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

Example
The ordered list of scores is , so the second lowest score is . There are two students with that score: . Ordered alphabetically, the names are printed as:
alpha
beta

Solution:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    result = []
    for i in range(int(input())):
        name = input()  
        score = float(input())  
        result.append([name, score])



score = set([student[1] for student in result])
second_lowest = sorted(score)[1]

student_second_lowest = [student[0] for student in result if student[1] == second_lowest]
student_second_lowest.sort()

for name in student_second_lowest:
  print(name)
